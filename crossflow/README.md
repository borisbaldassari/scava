HOW TO USE:
-----------

1. Download the Eclipse Epsilon Distribution from: http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/download/

2. Clone repository.

3. Import projects to Eclipse workspace as projects using the Eclipse "Existing Projects into Workspace" dialog.

Projects org.eclipse.scava.crossflow.language.* contain the workflow metamodel and graphical editor.

Projects org.eclipse.scava.crossflow.restmule.* contain the resilient clients used by crossflow.

Project org.eclipse.scava.crossflow contains the Epsilon-based code generators used to create Java code from a workflow model.

Project org.eclipse.scava.crossflow.runtime contains the execution engine for workflows.

Project org.eclipse.scava.crossflow.examples contains examples of workflows that can be executed.

3. To use the graphical editor launch a new eclipse that includes these plugins in its execution and create a new crossflow model or open an existing one using the crossflow diagram editor.
